# Inventory Management System (Frontend)

## Overview

This is the frontend implementation for the Inventory Management System, designed to interact with the backend services for managing inventory, suppliers, stock movements, and sales orders. The frontend is a lightweight, static web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Interactive user interface for managing inventory operations
- Integration with backend services via REST APIs
- Real-time updates on stock and sales order statuses

## Deployment

### Live Demo
The frontend is deployed using GitHub Pages and can be accessed at the following URL:  
[**Inventory Management UI**](https://anirudhmaurya.github.io/inventory-management--ui/)

### Note
- The backend services are hosted on a free tier of Render, which sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity. It may take some time to respond initially while the server reboots.

## Project Structure
The project contains the following files:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the application.
- **styles.css**: The stylesheet for designing the application layout and styling.
- **scripts.js**: The JavaScript file for handling user interactions and API communication.

## Backend Integration
The frontend communicates with the backend API endpoints deployed at Render.
To run this locally update the base URLs for api calls.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anirudhmaurya/inventory-management--ui.git
   cd inventory-management--ui
   ```
2. Open the index.html file in any browser to launch the application.
